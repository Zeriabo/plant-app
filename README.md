## Architecture Overview
  The app follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into different folders and components:
  components:
  - Screens: Contains main views (List View, Scan View, Details View, Profile, Settings).
  - State Management: Uses Redux Toolkit for managing saved photos and theme mode.
  - Navigation: Uses React Navigation to switch between tabs.
  - Storage: Stores photos locally using Redux state.
  Technical Decisions
  - React Native with Expo: Chosen for fast development and easy deployment.
  - Redux Toolkit: Provides centralized state management for better performance.
  - React Native Paper: Used for UI components to ensure a consistent design.
  - Expo Image Picker: Simplifies photo capture and selection.
  - UUID: Generates unique IDs for saved photos so its easy to update.
  - Dark Mode Support: Implemented using Redux to toggle between themes later if needed theme can be changed in the other screen.
